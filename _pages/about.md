I apply and develop techniques for evaluating the effects of treatments, policies, and ads through the lens of Donald Rubin's causal model, as described by [Paul Holland](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1986.10478354). Particular methodological interests include matching, missing data, measurement error, covariate balance, covariance adjustment, randomization tests, sensitivity analysis, cluster-robust variance estimation, and effect generalizability. I have applied my methods to the Texas Education Agency's Additional Days School Year [(ADSY)](https://tea.texas.gov/academics/learning-support-and-programs/additional-days-school-year/adsy-frequently-asked-questions) initiative and the [SUNFISH trial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34942136/) for assessing the effects of risdiplam on spinal muscular atrophy. Previous work includes ad testing and election forecasting at Civis Analytics. I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in statistics at the University of Michigan advised by [Professor Ben Hansen](https://dept.stat.lsa.umich.edu/~bbh/).
